            <h1>About the game:</h1>
            <p>The game I have developed is set in a tumultuous, storm-ravaged city. As a player, your primary goal is to survive in this challenging environment while eliminating as many opponents as possible. Achieving this objective will require a significant amount of effort, strategy, and skill.
                Surviving in the stormy city requires the player to navigate through treacherous terrain, such as flooded streets and collapsed buildings. The player must also contend with the unpredictable weather, which can change suddenly, creating dangerous conditions.
                To eliminate opponents, the player must engage in battles using various weapons and tactics. These confrontations will challenge the player's reflexes, accuracy, and decision-making skills, making every encounter a thrilling and intense experience.
                As the game progresses, the player will encounter more difficult opponents and encounter new challenges, requiring the player to adapt and refine their strategies continuously. The player will also have to explore the city to find new weapons, tools, and resources to aid in their survival and battle against opponents.
                Overall, the game I have created is an immersive and exciting experience that will challenge and reward players who are up for the challenge. The combination of intense battles, challenging terrain, and unpredictable weather creates a unique and dynamic gameplay experience that will keep players engaged and entertained for hours.
