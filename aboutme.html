      <h1>about me:</h1>
      <p>
        Hello and welcome to my about me page!My name is Ellis, and I am a 17-year-old student who has a passion for creativity and design. Recently, I have designed and developed a survival game that has received a lot of attention from my peers and even some game
         development studios.My love for gaming began at a young age, and I have always been interested in the mechanics behind the games that I play. As I grew older, I became more interested in game design and began to study different game engines and design
          principles. This led me to develop my own game using Unreal engine, a popular game engine used by professionals in the industry.The survival game that I designed is set in a post-apocalyptic world where the player must scavenge for resources, build shelter, and 
          fight off dangerous creatures to survive. The game is designed to be challenging, but also fun and engaging, with different levels of difficulty to cater to all types of players.I put a lot of time and effort into designing the game, from creating the
           graphics and sound effects to programming the different mechanics. I wanted to create a game that was not only enjoyable to play but also visually stunning and immersive.Aside from game development, I am also passionate about other forms of creative
            expression, such as writing and photography. I enjoy exploring different mediums and experimenting with new techniques to expand my skillset.In the future, I hope to pursue a career in the game development industry and continue to create engaging and 
            innovative games that inspire and entertain players.Thank you for taking the time to learn about me and my passion for game design. If you have any questions or would like to play my survival game, feel free to reach out to me
